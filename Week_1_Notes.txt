CSC570 Notes for Week One:
    - Summary:
        - Course logistics and expectations
        - Edge vs core network structure
        - TCP/IP Layers
        - Packet vs Circuit switching

    Some History:
        - Cerf and Kahn are internet founding fathers
            - Vinton Cerf: Born 1943, DARPA program manager, funded and chairman of ICANN, president of ACM (idk what any of these acronyms mean) 
            - Bob Kahn: Born 1938, PHD from City University in NY, worked at AT&T, professor at MIT

        What did they do?
            - Establish networking principles that define today's Internet architecture:
                1. minimalism, autonomy: no internal changes are required to interconnect networks.
                2. best effort service model
                3. stateless router
        
    Network Devices:
        - Endhosts (server and clients)
        - Routers, switches, and hubs to connect Endhosts
        - A network => some number of endhosts connected via routers, hubs, and switches
        - The internet interconnects networks
    
    Types of Networks:
        "Not all networks are created equal D:"
        1. Edge network: carry their own traffic, control themsevles
        2. Core network: carries their own traffic as well as traffic for customers (transit traffic)
