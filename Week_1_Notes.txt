CSC570 Notes for Week One:
    - Summary:
        - Course logistics and expectations
        - Edge vs core network structure
        - TCP/IP Layers
        - Packet vs Circuit switching

    Some History:
        - Cerf and Kahn are internet founding fathers
            - Vinton Cerf: Born 1943, DARPA program manager, funded and chairman of ICANN, president of ACM (idk what any of these acronyms mean) 
            - Bob Kahn: Born 1938, PHD from City University in NY, worked at AT&T, professor at MIT

        What did they do?
            - Establish networking principles that define today's Internet architecture:
                1. minimalism, autonomy: no internal changes are required to interconnect networks. Network owners have full control over the network.
                2. best effort service model. Does not have any guarantees, but will do best.
                3. stateless router. Does not remember packets that are sent. Router does not keep state. Helps with performance and efficency.
                    - How does a router work?
                        - Once packet comes in, router checks destination ip to figure where to send the packet.
    
    Packet: Chunks of data with headers? (what is a header)

    Circuit-Switching: has a dedicated path and resources. Reserve path end-to-end. No need to use packets.
    Packet-Switching: Splitting content into smaller chunks. Packets competing for resources (memory and cpu). Make better use of network resources.
        - Source of delays: transmission delays -> time it takes a packet to be converted into a signal.

    Utilization = fraction of time of using something.

    What are buffers? 

    Taking signals and mapping into data = Demodulation
    Taking data and mapping into signals = Modulation

    How is coding involved?
        - Error detection and correction

    Network Devices:
        - Endhosts (server and clients)
        - Routers, switches, and hubs (intermediate notes) to connect Endhosts
        - A network => some number of endhosts connected via routers, hubs, and switches
        - The internet interconnects networks => collection of networks
    
    TCP/IP: End to end protcol that enables something to be sent. Ensures whatever is sent is actually recieved. Does not congest the network, tries to not lose packets.
    DNS: maps name to ip address (name of the device).
    All devices have an ip address
    FTP: App that runs ontop of TCP for file transfers.

    Types of Networks:
        "Not all networks are created equal D:"
        1. Edge network: carry their own traffic, control themsevles
        2. Core network: carries their own traffic as well as traffic for customers (transit traffic)

    Mesh: Each node connects to some of its neighbors
    Logical topology vs. Physical topology?
        - Physcial topology: Actual hardware, how nodes are connected through use of cables and network devices.
        - Logical topology: How data flows through networks regardless of physical connection.

    Two networks communicate through each other through routers.
